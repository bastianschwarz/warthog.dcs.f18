# HOTAS Warthog profile for DCS F/A-18C Hornet
T.A.R.G.E.T. profile for the Thrustmaster HOTAS Warthog and DCS World FA-18C Hornet

This profile was inspired by the great [F-18 Profile][noid_f18_profile_url] created by [NOiD][noid_profile_url]. You should check out this profile if you like having more functions bound to your HOTAS using modifier buttons.

## Goals

- __Reduce cognitive load__: Remembering stuff is hard, especially if you don't have time to play a lot and/or 
  regularly and it's not a good thing when you have to remember your key mapping in combat. This problem is 
  aggravated when there are a lot of multi-assignments with modifiers.
  
  This profile aims to reduce the use of modifiers especially on the stick and throttle. There will be some but they will be mostly 
  on the throttle instrument panel.

- __Minimal configuration__: The profile is designed to work with the default button mapping of DCS where possible. This should reduce the
  need for initial configuration and when new modules are realeased.
  
- __Relation to real life__: The US Air Force and the US Navy have put a lot of time and thought in designing their 
  HOTAS and "Button Mapping" so I will definiatley try and take adavantage of that.
  
- __F-16__: I started out years ago in Falcon 4 and spent a lot of time in the (virtual) F-16 cockpit so the control scheme is somhow
  still pretty much ingrained into my flying. And since the F-16 teaser Eagle Dynamics put in their awsome 
  [2018 video][dcs_2018_youtube_url] I think it is a good Idea to keep the 2 schemes somewhat related.
  
- __Flexibility__: The plan is to make the profile interchangeable with other modules, either as is or by including different macro
  definitions so the scheme can stay the same between different planes.
  
## Usage

Download the package from the releases, extract to a folder (I put mine in `..\Saved Games\DCS\Layouts\[plane]\`) and run it with T.A.R.G.E.T

As soon as the profile runs you can run DCS. Make sure the button mapping for the keyboard is default. Assign the AXIS (I might put in a .diff.lua for this) and you are pretty much good to go.
